/**
 * Fill the dashboard with plausible demo data — M4.
 *
 * Why this exists. The owner asked to see the prototype's dashboard working, and a dashboard
 * that is honest about having no data is a dashboard where eleven panels read "not reported".
 * That is correct and it is useless for judging a design. So: one command puts a district's
 * worth of plausible activity behind the screen, and one command takes it away again.
 *
 *     node scripts/demo-data.mjs         # fill
 *     node scripts/demo-data.mjs --clear # remove every trace of it
 *
 * **Everything it writes is marked.** Utility notes end with a marker, alerts carry it, and
 * presence notes carry it. That is what `--clear` finds, and it is also what stops this
 * quietly becoming the district's real data six months from now. The marker is deliberately
 * visible in the interface rather than hidden in a column: a green tick nobody earned is the
 * most expensive kind of lie a control room can tell, and one that says "(demo)" beside it is
 * not a lie at all.
 *
 * It refuses to run against a database that looks like production, for the same two-check
 * reason `reset-test-db.mjs` does.
