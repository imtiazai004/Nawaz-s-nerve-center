/**
 * Empty the **test** database and re-apply every migration.
 *
 * Why this exists: the local test database is never cleaned, so every run leaves its seats,
 * departments and events behind. After a few weeks of that it held **1528 departments** —
 * where Bannu has 79 — and the administration console's browser test began timing out
 * rendering a screen no real district will ever produce.
 *
 * That is worth more than an annoyance. A test database that drifts this far stops telling
 * the truth in both directions: it hides real slowness behind noise, and it invents slowness
 * that does not exist. It also pushed several suites into inventing per-run name suffixes to
 * avoid colliding with their own history.
 *
 * CI never hits this — the workflow starts a fresh PostgreSQL service container every run —
 * so this is a local hygiene tool, run when the local database has drifted, not part of the
 * normal test command.
 *
 *     node scripts/reset-test-db.mjs
 *
 * **It refuses to run against anything but a database named for testing.** `incident_event`
 * blocks TRUNCATE by trigger (ADR-0001), which is correct and non-negotiable, so the only way
 * to empty it is to drop the schema — and dropping the wrong schema is the one mistake here
 * with no undo.
