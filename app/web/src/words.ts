/**
 * The words the district uses, in one place.
 *
 * Category codes and raw minute counts leaked onto the board the moment it became cards and
 * the text got larger: "rta" beside "Fire", and "1641m past deadline" where a person would
 * say "27 hours". Both were there before and were simply small enough to overlook.
 *
 * The mapping is duplicated on the server for the dashboard feed, which is deliberate: the
 * dashboard sends words because it is read by people who may never open the report form, and
 * the board translates locally because it already holds the code for filtering. Sharing one
 * module across the wire would mean the client could not filter without a round trip.
