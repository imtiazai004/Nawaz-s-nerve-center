/**
 * Finding an old emergency, on a screen — capability group 9.
 *
 * `/search` existed for a day with nothing calling it, which is not a capability. An officer
 * asked to produce a post-incident report about something from March had no way to reach it
 * unless somebody had written the incident id down.
 *
 * Two things this screen must do that a results list does not do by default:
 *
 * **Say what it searched.** An empty result and an empty *window* look identical, and only one
 * of them means the emergency never happened. The server resolves and echoes the window
 * precisely so a screen can print it; printing it is the whole point (ADR-0005 — an absence is
 * never rendered as a fact).
 *
 * **Say when there is more.** "200 results" and "at least 200 results" are different answers,
 * and only one of them means somebody should narrow the search.
 *
 * Rows are built by the same `incidentRow` the board uses, so an incident found here reads
 * exactly as it does there — including its unmet notifications, which is the thing a search
 * result would otherwise quietly drop.
