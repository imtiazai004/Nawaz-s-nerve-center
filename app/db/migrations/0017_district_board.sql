-- 0017 — the rest of the district's condition board (M4).
--
-- Three additions, all so the dashboard can answer what the owner's prototype answers.
--
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1. One mechanism, not four
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- The prototype has "Market Status", "Schools Status", "Hospital Status" and "Road Closures"
-- as four separate things beside its five utilities. They are not four things. Every one of
-- them has exactly the shape `utility` already has: **a name, a state, a note, and an age.**
--
-- So rather than four new tables, four new endpoints and four new console screens, `utility`
-- gains a `panel` column and the district gets rows. Bijli and bazaar are the same kind of
-- fact reported the same way, and the district can add a fifth kind next year without a
-- release — the same argument ADR-0003 makes about authority rules and ADR-0010 about routing.
--
-- The name `utility` is now slightly narrow for what the table holds. Renaming it would touch
-- the store, the API, the console and two test files to buy nothing a comment cannot; the
-- comment is here instead.

BEGIN;

ALTER TABLE utility ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS panel text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'utility';

ALTER TABLE utility DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS utility_panel_known;
ALTER TABLE utility
    ADD CONSTRAINT utility_panel_known CHECK (panel IN ('utility', 'services'));

-- The four the prototype named. Seeded with **no report**, exactly like the utilities were:
-- a board that opens claiming the markets are open, because a migration said so, is lying on
-- the day it is installed.

-- 2. The facts about Bannu that do not change on a Tuesday
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- Tehsils, union councils, population, area. These are not *reports* — nobody watches them,
-- they have no age worth showing, and treating them like the panels above would put "updated
-- 4 months ago" beside a number that is supposed to be four months old.
--
-- They are also **not constants in code**. A census happens; a tehsil is created. The two
-- offices set these from the console, and every change lands in the config log like any other.
--
-- Deliberately free text rather than numbers: "1,167,892" and "1,227 km²" are how a district
-- writes them, and parsing that into an integer to render it back with separators is work
-- that buys a validation error nobody wanted.

-- 3. Alerts and advisories
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- VIP movement, a security advisory, a road closure, a weather warning. The district's own
-- announcements — not emergencies, and deliberately not stored as them: an emergency has a
-- responsible department, an acknowledgement deadline and an escalation ladder, and none of
-- those mean anything for "Kohat Road is closed for maintenance".
--
-- **Issued by the two offices only**, at the owner's instruction (2026-08-03). A district-wide
-- advisory is an administrative announcement; every department reads it. The alternative —
-- any department posting to the board every office reads — is a board nobody can trust, and
-- the district plans around what is on it.
