-- 0015 — what a wall screen shows, and what it signs in as (M4, ADR-0013).
--
-- Three things arrive together because they exist for one reason: the DC office and the AC
-- Headquarter want a screen on the wall that answers "what is the state of the district right
-- now", and two of its panels ask for facts the system has never held.
--
--   * `utility_report`  — is the electricity on? the water? the gas? the internet?
--   * `presence_report` — is the AAC in his office, in the field, or on leave?
--   * `wall_screen`     — the identity a television signs in as, which is not a person's
--
-- The first two are **department-reported**, in the owner's sense: a department manages its
-- own data, and nobody else types on its behalf. PESCO says whether PESCO is up.
--
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Why these are reports, not states
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- The tempting shape is a column: `utility.status = 'normal'`. It is wrong for the same
-- reason a board table would be wrong (ADR-0001). A status column answers "what is it now"
-- and silently destroys "since when, and who says so" — which on a wall screen is the whole
-- question. ADR-0013 §3: a green dot with no age is silence wearing the costume of an answer.
--
-- So each of these is an append-only stream of **reports**, and the current value is the
-- latest one, carrying its own timestamp and its own author. A panel can then say "normal,
-- updated 14 minutes ago" — or, past the district's threshold, stop claiming "normal" at all
-- and say "not reported since 09:40".
