-- 0010 — the ladder has two rungs, and the seat table now says so (M1a-09, ADR-0010).
--
-- `tier` has carried four values since migration 0003: station, tehsil, district,
-- provincial. That was a generic hierarchy invented before anybody had told us how Bannu is
-- organised, and ADR-0010 replaced it with the district's own answer: **two offices are the
-- authority, everything else is a department, and there is no third rung.**
--
-- Collapsing the enum was filed as a follow-up rather than a prerequisite. It stops being
-- cosmetic here, because of what the district's own data turned out to look like.
--
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- What this fixes, and it is not tidiness
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- Every one of the 83 seats loaded from the district's contact list is `district` tier.
--
-- Not a decision anybody made. The contact list has no tier column, so `ops/directory.ts`
-- defaulted every row — and `evaluateRead` widens at tehsil, meaning **tehsil and above may
-- read every incident in the district**. The consequence, live in the loaded roster right
-- now: the Education department's duty officer can read Rescue 1122's incidents, and the
-- Agriculture Extension officer can read the DPO's.
--
-- `docs/04-authority-model.md` says cross-department access is denied by default. In the
-- district's real data it is currently denied to nobody. A default I introduced, not a fact
-- the district supplied, which is why this migration corrects it rather than reporting it
-- and waiting.
--
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The rule
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- A seat is `district` when it belongs to an administrative office (ADR-0010), or when it
-- belongs to no department at all — the control room and any district-wide post, for which
-- `department_id IS NULL` is how "not one department's" is already expressed.
--
-- Everything else is `department`.
--
-- Enforced by a trigger rather than left to callers. The API already refuses to let a
-- department create a post above its own rung, but a tier that can drift out of step with
-- `is_administration` is a silent widening of who can read what, and that is precisely the
-- class of bug worth spending ten lines of plpgsql on.
