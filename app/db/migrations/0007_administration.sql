-- 0007 — the administration console: routing signals, SLA targets, and a config history.
--
-- ADR-0010 made the DC Office and the AC Headquarter Bannu Office the authority for the
-- whole district, with every other department reporting to them. That turns three things
-- which were previously code, guesses, or open questions into **data those two offices
-- edit**:
--
--   * which department answers for which kind of emergency  (was: nothing at all)
--   * how long a department has to acknowledge               (was: PLACEHOLDER_SLA in code)
--   * whether a department exists                            (was: a seed file)
--
-- The third one already had a table (0005). This migration adds the first two, and adds the
-- thing all three need and none of them had: **a record of who changed the configuration,
-- when, and why.**

BEGIN;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Configuration history — the same argument as ADR-0001, applied to settings
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- `incident_event` is append-only because the district's record of what happened must not
-- be quietly rewritten. Configuration deserves the same treatment for a reason that only
-- becomes obvious after an incident review:
--
--   "Why was this not flagged late?"  — because on that night the target was 60 minutes.
--   "Why did this go to the wrong department?" — because that signal was added on Tuesday.
--
-- A settings table that only holds the current value cannot answer either question. It
-- makes every past judgement of the system unexplainable, and it makes the two offices'
-- own decisions unattributable. So configuration changes are events too, in their own log,
-- with the same append-only guarantee.
--
-- Separate from `incident_event` on purpose: these are not facts about an incident, they
-- have no incident id, and folding them into the incident log would mean every projection
-- and every replay had to skip rows that are not about incidents at all.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- ADR-0010: "Routing is configuration, not inference." A signal is a match rule the
-- administration writes against a department. Two kinds, deliberately only two:
--
--   category — the incident's category equals this, exactly, after normalisation.
--              Precise. What you use once categories settle down.
--   keyword  — this word appears in the category or the description text.
--              Forgiving. What you use on day one, when reports are free text in a hurry.
--
-- No regular expressions and no boolean expressions. A routing rule that needs debugging
-- is a routing rule that will send a fire to the wrong department at 02:00, and the person
-- editing it is an administrator under pressure, not a programmer (ADR-0007).

-- the DC and AC Headquarter offices set these themselves, which makes the guess a default
-- value rather than a fact.

-- goes dark whenever that particular chair is empty.
--
-- **Not settable through the admin API, deliberately.** These two offices can create and
-- retire departments, so if they could also grant this flag they could mint a third
-- administration, which is exactly what ADR-0010 forbids. Changing it is a deliberate act at
-- the database by whoever holds the server, and it should require the conversation that
-- implies. There is no screen for it and that is the feature.
