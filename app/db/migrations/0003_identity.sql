-- 0003 — identity: people, seats, duty, sessions.
--
-- ADR-0004: authority attaches to a *seat*, never to a person. Officers in this district
-- transfer frequently, and a permission model tied to individuals breaks on every posting
-- order while quietly leaving departed officers with access.
--
-- The consequence for this schema: a person is only ever an authenticated human. What they
-- may *do* comes from the seat they hold right now, which is a row in duty_assignment with
-- an open time range. Revoke the assignment and the authority is gone the same instant,
-- with no cleanup step for anyone to forget.
