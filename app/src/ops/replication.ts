/**
 * Is the standby keeping up? — M0-54, ADR-0011.
 *
 * ADR-0011 puts a warm standby in the AC Headquarter office: two machines, one record. The
 * decision it turns on is that **two independent primaries would give Bannu two divergent
 * histories and no way to merge them** — so the standby is read-only and exists for one
 * night, the one where the DC office machine does not come back.
 *
 * That only works if somebody notices when it stops replicating. A standby that fell behind
 * three weeks ago and told nobody is not a standby; it is a comforting fiction, and the
 * district finds out at the moment it is relied on. So the lag goes on `/health`, beside the
 * backup age, for the same reason and with the same argument.
 *
 * **Reported, never enforced.** `/health` returns `degraded` at 200 and never a failing
 * status code. A 503 because replication is behind would take the node out of a load balancer
 * and stop the district reporting emergencies — INV-01 outranks a lagging standby, and an
 * operator who cannot file a report has no way to know replication was the reason.

 * number that matters operationally is not this one — it is that somebody looks.
