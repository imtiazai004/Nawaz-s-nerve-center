/**
 * Backup and restore — M0-37, and the mechanism M0-38's human drill follows.
 *
 * **This is a real round trip.** It runs `pg_dump` against the real cluster, writes a real
 * file, replays it into a real second database with `psql`, and then reads the event log
 * back out and compares it. Nothing here is mocked, because the only property worth testing
 * is the one a mock cannot have: that the emergencies come back.
 *
 * What this does **not** do is close M0-38. A restore performed by the person who wrote the
 * restore code, on their own machine, against their own dump, is a test of the code. The
 * gate asks for a drill by somebody else, and it stays open until somebody else has done it.
 * See `docs/08-runbook.md`.
