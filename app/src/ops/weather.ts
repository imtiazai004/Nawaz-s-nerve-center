/**
 * Bannu's weather, fetched by the server — M4-04, ADR-0013.
 *
 * Why the server and not the television:
 *
 * **One fetch serves every screen.** Two offices with a screen each, plus anybody who opens
 * the app, is one request every fifteen minutes instead of a request per viewer per load.
 *
 * **A kiosk browser is a public browser.** Any key it holds is a key on the wall. Open-Meteo
 * needs no key, which is most of why it was chosen (ADR-0007: the boring option) — but a
 * decision that only works because today's provider is free is a decision that breaks on the
 * day it is not.
 *
 * **A district with no internet says so once, honestly.** If each screen fetched for itself,
 * a line failure would leave three televisions each showing a different stale number with no
 * way to tell. Here there is one reading, with one age, and the panel states it.
 *
 * Nothing here throws on a failed fetch. Weather is the least important thing on the screen
 * and must never be able to take the screen down with it.
