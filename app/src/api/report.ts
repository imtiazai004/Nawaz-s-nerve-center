/**
 * The post-incident report over HTTP — M1-06.
 *
 * This module gathers; `domain/report.ts` folds. The split matters because the fold is where
 * every judgement lives — what counts as a gap, what a duration is measured from — and those
 * are testable without a database.
 *
 * **Authority is the incident's.** You may take a report of an emergency you are permitted to
 * read, and there is no separate report permission to fall out of step with that (INV-05).
 * A refused read is a 404, as everywhere else: confirming an incident exists to a seat with
 * no business seeing it is itself a disclosure.
