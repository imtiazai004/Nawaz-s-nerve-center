/**
 * Uploading and fetching evidence — M1-05, over HTTP.
 *
 * **Raw body, not multipart.** A phone posts the file as the request body with the filename
 * in a header. Parsing multipart by hand in `node:http` is a hundred lines of state machine
 * that has historically been where the interesting bugs are, and adding a framework to avoid
 * writing it would be exactly the dependency ADR-0007 exists to refuse. A single file per
 * request loses nothing: the client sends three requests for three photographs, and each one
 * that succeeds is durable on its own — which is better behaviour on a bad connection than
 * one request that fails at 90%.
 *
 * **Authority comes from the incident**, always. You may attach evidence to an emergency you
 * are permitted to read and act on, and you may fetch evidence from an incident you are
 * permitted to read. There is no separate evidence permission to get out of step with the
 * incident one (INV-05).
