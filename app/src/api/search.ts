/**
 * Finding an old emergency — capability group 9, "full-history search".
 *
 * The board shows the last seven days because that is what a shift needs. Everything older was
 * reachable only by already knowing its incident id, which means a post-incident report about
 * something from March could be produced by anybody who had written the id down and by nobody
 * else. A record you cannot search is a filing cabinet without a drawer label.
 *
 * **This shares the board's projection and differs only in selection.** `projectIncidents`
 * does the fold, `evaluateRead` and `toRow`; search only decides *which* incidents to hand it.
 * That split is the point: two implementations of "what is the state of this incident" would
 * eventually disagree, and then a search result and the board would say different things about
 * the same emergency on the same screen.
 *
 * **Scoping is therefore the board's scoping, not a copy of it.** A department searching finds
 * its own incidents and never learns that a neighbour's exists — not hidden in the results,
 * never returned (INV-05).
