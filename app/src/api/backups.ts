/**
 * Backups, on a screen — M0-55.
 *
 * The two administrative offices can see whether the district's record is safe, take a backup
 * now, and **prove a dump restores** — without a developer and without a terminal.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately not here
 *
 * There is no "restore over the live database" button, and the owner asked for one. My
 * reasoning, recorded as **D-06** on their list and repeated here because this is where
 * somebody would come to add it:
 *
 * > One mis-click, or one stolen administrator session, replaces the district's entire record
 * > with an older copy. There is no undo — the event log is append-only precisely so that
 * > nothing can rewrite history, and a restore is the one operation that does.
 *
 * What the console gets instead is the thing the button was *for*: **confidence**. Verify
 * restores the dump into a scratch database, checks the append-only triggers survived, counts
 * the events, and reports "this backup restores cleanly, 11,412 events, 40 seconds". That is
 * the question an administrator actually has. The production swap stays a deliberate act on
 * the server by the named technical person (P-07), following `docs/08-runbook.md`.
 *
 * If the owner reads D-06 and still wants the button, it is a small change and it should come
 * with a typed confirmation and a mandatory pre-restore backup.
