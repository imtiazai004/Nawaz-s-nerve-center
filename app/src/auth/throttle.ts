/**
 * Slowing down guessing, without ever locking anybody out — M5's security review.
 *
 * `passwords.ts` sets a deliberately low ten-character minimum and justifies it by saying
 * *"real protection here comes from rate limiting and instant revocation"*. Revocation existed.
 * This is the other half, and it was missing.
 *
 * ## The answer this deliberately is not: an account lockout
 *
 * The district's numbers are semi-public and the roster says who holds which post. **A lockout
 * is a denial of service an attacker can aim at a named officer** — ten wrong passwords
 * against the Rescue duty officer's number at 01:50 would lock out precisely the person the
 * system exists to reach, and they would discover it at the moment it mattered. INV-01
 * outranks a failed-login counter exactly as it outranks a stale backup on `/health`.
 *
 * So nothing here ever refuses. It **delays**, and the delay is bounded. An officer who
 * mistypes their password waits milliseconds; somebody working through a wordlist waits
 * seconds per attempt, which is the difference between a feasible attack and an infeasible
 * one. A duty officer typing carefully at 02:00 is never told to come back later.
 *
 * ## What is actually being protected
 *
 * Not mainly the passwords — the **CPU**. `/auth/login` is unauthenticated and performs a
 * scrypt derivation on every attempt, *including for numbers with no account*, deliberately,
 * so that response time reveals nothing about who is real. On one machine in the DC office
 * that is also accepting emergency reports, an unauthenticated endpoint that burns a scrypt
 * per request is a cheap way to make the district stop answering. Hence `withScryptSlot`:
 * login can queue for the CPU, and intake never waits behind it.
 *
 * ## Two keys, because there are two attacks
 *
 * Per **number** catches somebody working on one officer. Per **source** catches somebody
 * spraying one password across the district's whole contact list, where no single number ever
 * accumulates enough failures to be noticed.
 *
 * ## In memory, on purpose
 *
 * ADR-0011 deploys one node; ADR-0007 says boring. A table would mean a write on every failed
 * attempt — load added exactly when the system is under load — and a restart clearing the
 * counters costs an attacker one restart's worth of delay, which is not the difference between
 * safe and unsafe. Attempts that matter are still visible: failures are counted and exposed
 * for `/health` and the console rather than kept only in here.
