 * captured offline in March and delivered in August has `occurred_at` in March — so filtering
 * on arrival would file it under the day the network came back, and the district's worst
 * weeks, when devices were offline longest, would be exactly the weeks that searched emptiest
 * (ADR-0002). Migration 0019 adds the index this needs.
 *
 * **Always bounded by a date range**, and the caller is not allowed to omit it. The event log
 * is the record and grows forever; an unbounded `ILIKE` across it would scan every emergency
 * the district has ever had, on the one machine that is also accepting new ones.
 *
 * **The text match is deliberately unindexed.** A trigram index would need `pg_trgm` and a
 * migration, and at Bannu's volume — a district, not a country — a bounded range already
 * reduces this to a scan of the window somebody asked for. If that stops being true, the fix
 * is an index and not a smaller window: a search that silently stops looking at older
 * emergencies is worse than a slow one.
 *
 * The `LIMIT` is on distinct incidents, applied before the events are fetched, so a single
 * long-running incident cannot crowd out the rest of a page.
