 * These lived in `api/lifecycle.ts` because intake was the only thing that needed them.
 * Routing needs them too — it must refuse to route on a placeholder — and a domain module
 * importing from the API layer would have the dependency backwards. So they moved down to
 * where both can reach them.
 *
 * Both constants are the **same string** on purpose. `unknown` is not a category and not a
 * severity level; it is the system saying *nobody told us*, in the one place a value is
 * required. Everything downstream keys off that: ADR-0009 keeps it out of severity
 * aggregates, and `domain/routing.ts` keeps it from satisfying a routing signal.

 * by the back door — but it has one fatal property: **on a screen, an assumption is
 * indistinguishable from an assessment.** The urgency now lives in the SLA target for
 * `unknown`, which is the `high` deadline, so an unassessed report still reaches a human
 * fast without the record claiming anyone judged it.
